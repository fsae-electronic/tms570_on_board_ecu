 @brief MCU allows large SPI transfers.

 microcontrolles. This has been added to support enhanced SPI
 access on BT82x.
 Do not make this larger than required as on BT82x (EVE API 5)
 there will be a stack buffer allocated in HAL_Read of this
 size plus a small number of bytes for protocol.
 A larger buffer is only needed if fast reads of large blocks
 of data are required from the device. Normal operation can be
 acheived with 32-bit reads with good performance.

/**
 @brief MCU SPI bus speed.
 @details In general, a port is responsible for ensuring timeout accuracy on the SPI bus.
 Timeout for a read is a maximum of 7uS for BT82x.
 The timeout value here must be adjusted for the host system SPI clock speed.
 The SPI clock speed is set in the MCU_Init(void) function for a port.
 Values here match the default values set in the ports.
 At 1 MHz SPI bus the timeout is approximately 8 clock cycles (1 byte).
 At 20 MHz SPI bus the timeout is approximately 140 clock cycles (17.5 bytes).
 At 25 MHz SPI bus the timeout is approximately 175 clock cycles (24 bytes).
 At 60 MHz SPI bus the timeout is approximately 420 clock cycles (52 bytes).
 The minimum timeout allowed is 8 bytes.
